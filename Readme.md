FareCore: Regular Expression Power for .NET Core 6+
===================================================

\[Insert badge for Build, NuGet package, etc. if you have them set up\]

FareCore is a .NET Core 6+ optimized fork of the popular Fare library, itself a port of the Java libraries dk.brics.automaton and xeger. This project was created to deliver the power of regular expression generation and manipulation specifically to modern .NET Core applications.

Key Features
------------

*   **String Generation from Regular Expressions:** Effortlessly generate random strings that flawlessly match predefined regular expression patterns.
    
*   **Finite Automata (NFA/DFA):** Construct and manipulate finite automata, ideal for complex pattern-matching tasks.
    
*   **Modern .NET Core Focus:** Meticulously tailored code optimizations for seamless integration into .NET Core 6 and newer projects.
    

Why FareCore?
-------------

*   **.NET Core Specialization:** FareCore's codebase is streamlined for efficiency and compatibility within the .NET Core 6+ ecosystem.
    
*   **Performance and Agility:** Experience potential performance gains and greater flexibility due to targeted optimizations specifically for .NET Core.
    
*   **Active Development (Depending on your plans):** Anticipate ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and potential additional features aligned with the .NET Core roadmap.
